# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
This project is a Twitter sentiment analysis application that aims to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) associated with tweets. The application utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment expressed in tweets, providing valuable insights for various purposes such as brand monitoring, social media analysis, and opinion mining.

Project Overview
The Twitter sentiment analysis application is built using Python and leverages the power of machine learning and NLP libraries such as NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and scikit-learn. The application collects tweets related to a specific topic or keyword, processes the text data, and classifies the sentiment of each tweet using a pre-trained machine learning model.

Features
Sentiment Classification: The application categorizes tweets into three sentiment classes: positive, negative, or neutral. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the sentiment distribution within the collected tweets.

Real-time Data Collection: The application fetches tweets in real-time using the Twitter API. This ensures that the sentiment analysis is based on the most recent and relevant data.

Data Preprocessing: Before sentiment analysis, the application performs various preprocessing tasks on the tweet text, including tokenization, removal of stop words, and stemming or lemmatization. These steps help improve the accuracy of sentiment classification.

Visualizations: The application provides visualizations such as bar charts and pie charts to represent the sentiment distribution of the collected tweets. These visualizations offer a quick and intuitive understanding of the sentiment trends.
